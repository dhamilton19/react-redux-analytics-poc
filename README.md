# POC of Redux-Analytics

This repo is a proof of concept of a redux analytics pattern.

The Starter kit used is Cory House's: https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot

## Questions:
1. How do you exclude events from triggering analytics?
2. How does the HOC access the store?
3. What properties need to be passed to the HOC and should they be excluded from being passed to the Component?
