# POC of Redux-Analytics

This repo is a proof of concept of a redux analytics pattern.

The Starter kit used is Cory House's: https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot

## Questions:
1. How do you exclude events from triggering analytics?
2. How should the HOC access the store?
3. What properties need to be passed to the HOC for analytics ? Should they be excluded from being passed to the Component?
